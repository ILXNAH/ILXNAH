> ðŸŽ­ "All the worldâ€™s a stage,  
> And all the men and women merely players;  
> They have their exits and their entrances,  
> And one man in his time plays many parts,  
> His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,  
> Mewling and puking in the nurseâ€™s arms.  
> Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel  
> And shining morning face, creeping like snail  
> Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,  
> Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad  
> Made to his mistressâ€™ eyebrow. Then a soldier,  
> Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,  
> Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,  
> Seeking the bubble reputation  
> Even in the cannonâ€™s mouth. And then the justice,  
> In fair round belly with good capon lined,  
> With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,  
> Full of wise saws and modern instances;  
> And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts  
> Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,  
> With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;  
> His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide  
> For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,  
> Turning again toward childish treble, pipes  
> And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,  
> That ends this strange eventful history,  
> Is second childishness and mere oblivion,  
> Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."  
> â€” *William Shakespeare, As You Like It*
